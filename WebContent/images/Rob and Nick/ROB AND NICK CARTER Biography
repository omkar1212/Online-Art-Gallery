ROB AND NICK CARTER Biography

London-based husband and wife team Rob and Nick Carter work together to relentlessly explore the boundaries of photography, redefining possibilities and questioning tendencies, to create contemporary pieces that revolve around light, colour and form in many different mediums from painting and photography to light installations and film. 

The Paper Photographs are the duo’s first limited edition works on paper, and mark their latest departure. In these works, two ready made sheets of A4 Paper have been photographed in a three dimensional sculptural format taking the form of a turning page, implying a gesture of anticipation, and then printed back onto the original paper from which it came. The Carters are interested in the process of the original material moving from paper to photograph and back to paper again; the gesture is elegant and simple and the results are both expected and unexpected, walking a fine line between sculpture, photography and drawing. 

Collectors of Rob and Nick’s work include Sir Elton John, The Beckhams, Simon Fuller, Philip Treacy, Mathew Williamson and Stephen Fry, and their work is in the corporate collections of many large companies including The Virgin Group, Sainsbury’s PLC and Reuters. Their work is held in permanent collections at the V&A, London and the Museum of Neon Art, Los Angeles. Collaborating as artists since they first married back in 1998, the Carters have exhibited widely in the UK and abroad. Their most recent solo show, Postcards from Vegas, in January 2011 featured a series of enlarged reproductions of old postcards overlaid with recreations of real neon signs
